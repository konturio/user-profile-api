"Welcome to Disaster Ninja!\n"
"==========================\n"
"\n"
"Do you want to be notified about ongoing disasters? Are you interested in instant population data and other analytics for any region in the world? Disaster Ninja showcases some of [Kontur](https://www.kontur.io/)’s "
"capabilities in addressing these needs.\n"
"\n"
"We initially designed it as a decision support tool for humanitarian mappers. Now it has grown in functionality and use cases. Whether you work in disaster management, build a smart city, or perform research on climate "
"change, Disaster Ninja can help you to:\n"
"\n"
"> ### 1. Stay up to date with the latest hazard events globally.\n"
">\n"
"> The Disasters panel continually refreshes to inform you about ongoing events. It consumes data from the [Kontur Event Feed](https://www.kontur.io/portfolio/event-feed/), which you can also access via an API.\n"
">\n"
"> ### 2. Focus on your area of interest.\n"
">\n"
"> The Drawing Tools panel allows you to draw or upload your own geometry on the map. You can also focus on a disaster-exposed area or an administrative unit — a country, city, or region.\n"
">\n"
"> ### 3. Get analytics for the focused area.\n"
">\n"
"> The Analytics panel shows the number of people living in that area per [Kontur Population](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population-dataset) and estimated mapping gaps in OpenStreetMap. Kontur’s customers have "
"access to hundreds of other indicators through Advanced Analytics.\n"
">\n"
"> ### 4. Explore data on the map and make conclusions.\n"
">\n"
"> The Layers panel gives you various options to display two indicators simultaneously on a bivariate map, e.g., population density and distance to the nearest fire station. Use the color legend to assess which areas "
"require attention.\n"
"> Hint: in general, green indicates low risk / few gaps, red — high risk / many gaps.\n"
"\n"
"In addition, you can switch to Reports in the left panel to access data on potential errors and inconsistencies in OpenStreetMap and help fix them by mapping the respective area with the JOSM editor.\n"
"\n"
"### [Go to the map now ➜](/ \"map\")\n"

"Ви хочете отримувати повідомлення про катастрофи? Вас цікавлять миттєві дані про населення та інша аналітика для будь-якого регіону світу? Disaster Ninja від [Kontur](https://www.kontur.io/) може задовольнити ці потреби.\n"
"\n"
"Ми розробили це як інструмент підтримки прийняття рішень для гуманітарних картографів. Тепер його функціональність зросла. Незалежно від того, чи працюєте ви в сфері боротьби зі стихійними лихами, будуєте розумне місто чи "
"проводите дослідження щодо зміни клімату, Disaster Ninja може вам допомогти:\n"
"\n"
"> ### 1. Будьте в курсі останніх катастроф у всьому світі.\n"
">\n"
"> Панель Катастроф постійно оновлюється, щоб інформувати вас про поточні події. Дані отримані з каналу подій [Kontur](https://www.kontur.io/portfolio/event-feed/), до якого також можна отримати доступ через API.\n"
">\n"
"> ### 2. Фокусуйтеся на вашій сфері інтересів.\n"
">\n"
"> Панель “Інструменти малювання” дозволяє малювати або завантажувати власну геометрію на карту. Ви також можете фокусуватися на області, що постраждала від стихійного лиха, або на адміністративній одиниці — країна, район "
"чи місто.\n"
">\n"
"> ### 3. Отримайте аналітику для вибраної області.\n"
">\n"
"> Панель Аналітика показує кількість людей, які проживають у цьому регіоні на основі [населення Kontur](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population-dataset) і потенційні прогалини картографування в OpenStreetMap. "
"Клієнти Kontur мають доступ до сотень інших показників за допомогою Детальної Аналітики.\n"
">\n"
"> ### 4. Досліджуйте дані на карті та робіть висновки.\n"
">\n"
"> Панель “Шари” надає різні параметри для одночасного відображення двох індикаторів на карті, наприклад, щільність населення та відстань до найближчої пожежної частини. Використовуйте легенду кольорів, щоб визначити, які "
"області потребують уваги.\n"
"> Підказка: загалом зелений колір означає низький ризик / мало прогалин, червоний — високий ризик / багато прогалин.\n"
"\n"
"Крім того, ви можете перейти до звітів на лівій панелі, щоб отримати доступ до даних про потенційні помилки та невідповідності в даних OpenStreetMap і допомогти їх виправити, наприклад за допомогою редактора JOSM.\n"
